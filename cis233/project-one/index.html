   <h3>My Background</h3>
 <p>I grew up in a suburb outside of the Chicagoland area. I migrated to Arizona to attend Arizona State right after my senior year in highschool.
I majored in Sociology with hopes to be a therapist. After i graduated, I worked several different jobs. I was a manager of a boxing and fitness gym, ABA therapist for 
children on the autism spectrum, taught children English in Vietnam for a few months and was a caseworker. Although I enjoyed many different jobs, after working as a caseworker, I decided
social work wasn't for me. I then started working at a company in their operations department and worked my way into their financial operations department as a business anaylst. Low and behold, I decided I didn't like working
in finance. My company was downsizing, so they offered optional layoffs before they did mandatory layoffs. I knew I wouldn't get laid off, so I opted in as a way out and was given a severance.
I took my severance and spent a few weeks in Europe. After, I came back from my trip, it was time to figure what the next step was.</p>
<h3>What I'm Doing Currently</h3>
<p>I knew I wanted to do something different and web development was always something I had wished I studied in school. I decided to start working towards my associates in web development. I went back to bartending and started working at an art studio that specializes
    in metalsmithing. Working at the art studiio, I've been able to use some photo editing skills, update their website, and create social media content. I really enjoy creating things. My goal is to become a frontend developer. I would love
    to eventually be a completly freelance web designer and start my own business. </p>
    <h3>Other Stuff</h3>
    <p>Outside of working 2 jobs and going back to school, I spend a lot of my time doing jiu jitsu, mountain biking, and creating metal jewelry. I also enjoy traveling with my partner and our dog (if we can bring him). This year we've gone to Puerto Rico, spent a week mountain biking in Colorado, saw Lady Gaga's Jazz
        and Piano show in Vegas, saw a metal show in San Francisco, and taken many trips to Sedona, Prescott, and Flagstaff. I look forward to this class and meeting everyone.
